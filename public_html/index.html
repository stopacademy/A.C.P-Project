         <h1>About Me</h1>
         <h2>My name is Aaron Peron and this is ABOUT ME.</h2>
         <p>Im a student in the app academy in PHS(Pasadena High school for short.<br/>
             I also have marching band practice after school.<br/>
             Just to be clear, I play the trumbone.<br/>
             This is my first year in high school.<br/>
             This is also my first web page project.<br/>
             High school isn't bad after all.<br/> 
             Well its Pasadena high is not but I don't know about the other schools.<br/>
             My portfolio is mainly about Games but the better ones.<br/>
             Not those boredom call of duty games, so fans of CoL....get out of this page<br/>
             So while (the user) reading this please enjoy the pic I stoll off of google as (the user) will be reading about me.<br/>
